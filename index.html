        <h3>Dave's impactful career decision</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Started his comedy career when he was a teenager.</li>
            <li>Had his own comedy show that made fun of stereotypes in a form of normalizing otherwise taboo topics.</li>
            <li>Walked away from a $3mill+ deal due to some racial injustices that he brought to light years later.</li>
            <li>He eases the tension of these injustices through comedy and brings down their guard to be receptive to his well thought description of the spoken joke/problem. </li>
            <li>He does not care about political correctness when telling jokes, a refreshing voice in a climate extremely concerned with watching what you say.</li>
            <li>He doesn't intend to be a movement leader, but has become one through the respect of those that respect him and his brashness. </li>
        </ul>
